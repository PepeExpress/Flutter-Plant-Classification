Polly is a mobile application for both iOS and Android made in Flutter, that let people discover the different entomophile species of plant around them, especially in the mediterranean area. 

Users can create their account and compete against other people from every area in the world to become the Plant Discoverer N°1. To gain points users have to take photos with the camera of their phones and answer to some question to determine the specie that is observing, when the quiz is finished the result obtained is validated with some machine learning algorithm 🦾🤖 that classifies the subject of the photo taken before. If there is a match the user get awarded some points!🎉🎉🎉

To become the Plant Discoverer N°1 you will have to complete your Herbary and find all the species present in the app! (Not easy)
